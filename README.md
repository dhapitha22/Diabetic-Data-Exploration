# 1. Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent non-communicable disease globally. It is a chronic condition characterized by excessively high blood glucose levels, typically regulated by the hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas. Diabetes arises when issues occur with this hormone and its function in the human bloodstream.

The number of diabetes cases is increasing worldwide, with the International Diabetes Federation reporting over 500 million people affected as of 2022. Furthermore, it caused an estimated 6.7 million deaths by the end of 2021, with many of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. Unfortunately, more than half of all diabetes cases remain undiagnosed. The World Health Organization predicts that the number of deaths will double by 2045, and diabetes can lead to numerous complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and eye problems.

Various risk factors are associated with diabetes. In this project, as a data scientist, I have used a dataset containing case scenarios and diagnoses from Frankfurt Hospital, Germany. The goal is to create an exploratory data analysis pipeline to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a given situation.

However, diabetes is linked with a variety of risk factors. As a data scientist, I used a dataset containing a part of situations and their conclusion from the hospital Frankfurt, Germany to create an experimental data analysis workflow to forecast whether diabetes will arise or not in a given scenario.

# Description of Dataset

The dataset consists of two groups: "Diabetes" and "No Diabetes". The various features in the dataset represent different risk factors for diabetes, which can be used to predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The "Outcome" column is the target variable that we aim to predict, with 0 indicating "No diabetes" and 1 indicating "diabetes".

The attributes in the dataset are as follows:

Pregnancies: The total number of times the patient has been pregnant (measured in number of pregnancies).

Glucose: The amount of glucose present in the patient's blood.

Blood Pressure: The patient's systolic blood pressure, expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

Skin Thickness: The measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the anterior abdomen, with an average thickness of 15.73 mm.

Insulin: The amount of insulin present in the patient's blood, measured in (mu U/ml).

BMI: A measure of body fat based on a person's height and weight, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.

Diabetes Pedigree Function: Information on the patient's family history of diabetes mellitus and genetic ties.

Age: The patient's current age in years.

Outcome: A binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not, with 0 indicating "No diabetes" and 1 indicating "diabetes".
